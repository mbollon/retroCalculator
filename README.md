App Developed during course "iOS 9 and Swift 2: From Beginner to Paid Professional"

This is the first major app developed using XCode 7.3 and iOS 9.2 for the online course I am taking on UDemy.

All of the graphics were provided by the course instructor.  However, I offer graphic design services and am able to design my own graphics.
